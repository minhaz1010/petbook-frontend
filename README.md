## üåü Key Features Explained

### Server-Side Rendering and Hydration

I have leveraged Next.js  App Router for efficient server-side rendering. This approach, combined with React Query's hydration capabilities, ensures fast initial page loads and smooth client-side navigation.

### Infinite Query

Implemented using React Query's `useInfiniteQuery`, this feature allows for seamless loading of content as users scroll, enhancing the browsing experience without overwhelming the server or the client.

### Rich Text Editing

React Quill is integrated to provide a powerful, user-friendly interface for creating and editing pet care tips and stories. This ensures that content creators can easily format their posts and include various media types.

### Responsive Design

The application is built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring a consistent and optimal user experience across devices of all sizes. I have used Tailwind CSS for efficient, responsive styling.

### TypeScript Integration

TypeScript is used throughout the project to ensure type safety.
